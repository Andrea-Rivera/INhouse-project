# INhouse-project
Automation project using Raspberry Pi

This project is designed to create a Web Application that will display a Calendar to schedule date and time of activation or deactivation for home appliances. 
 The user will use the web app to choose a day and time to turn on the home appliances.
 The server side (Raspberry Pi) will have three main functions:
1.	Web-server: to Host the Webpage Application.
2.	To connect the database with the web-server.
3.	To manage the I/O ports of the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi will receive the information from the database to turn ON/OFF the GPIO ports that will activate a LED to simulate the home appliances.
